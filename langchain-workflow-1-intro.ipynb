As for the veggies you can use whatever you have in your fridge. Before serving squeeze the remaining lime, stir and add 3 chopped scallions.

We cut the quinoa in half, tripled the veggies, and doubled the sauce. We used napa cabbage for this recipe and added in the broccoli florets as well. Red bell pepper would've been great with it as well. If you don't like the sauce tangy, add just a tsp or so of agave nectar. But it's still a great sauce without it. We didn't have salted peanuts, but instead added in some sweet chili pistachios because that's what was in the pantry. Think it would've been similar without them though. Overall, this is a must-keep and make over and over again recipe, but again, for us, the proportions were a bit off, so we'd make it our way. Thanks for the great recipe!\",\n",
